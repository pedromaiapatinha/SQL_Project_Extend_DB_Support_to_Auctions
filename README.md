# Extend SQL DB Support to Product Auctions

In the scope of the Managing Relational and Non-Relational Data course unit, from the Post-Graduation in Enterprise Data Science & Analytics, was proposed to us to solve two business problems related with a fictional company, Adventure Works.

The Adventure Works is an international company specialized in manufacturing and selling bicycles, that also sells other related products such as accessories, clothing, and bicycle components. As the company doesn’t have any physical stores, its business model is based in two main selling channels, direct sales to retail stores and online sales for the end user (individual customers). 
  
Within this context two business problems and the company’s relational database were given to us. The first problem is related with stock clearance. Every year a new bicycle model is revealed in December and every year, by this time, a high volume of previous model stock stills available in stores, which hinders the display of the most recent models. Besides Adventure Works performing some marketing campaigns, the previous model stock has been still an issue. This time, the company wants to try a different approach and do an online auction. A software company was contracted to extend the online store website to support online auctions. In parallel, our group carried the task of extend the current database model to also support the auction.
  
In the second business problem, Adventure Works revealed that wants to open two Brick and Mortar new physical stores in the United States, this way they would have a new and third way to do sales, more specifically, a new channel to sell directly to customers. Some concerns were provided to us in order to analyse their data available in the relational database and provide useful insights. Our insights and recommendations will be focused in naming the best cities to open these two stores, having in mind their requirements and recommendations.

The work done to solve these two business problems and our results will be mentioned and described throughout this report.
